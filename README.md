# Hot Drinks Vending Machine Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a vending machine simulation using Python, designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts through a practical, real-world example. The application models the core behavior of a vending machine, including money insertion, product selection, validation of sufficient balance, and change calculation.

The project is intentionally implemented as a console-based application. The focus is on clean Python logic and state-based behavior.
